Ok, now that we can read from a URL, get data out of the html (Just like in the headline lab), and write a page, we can finally get started on the lab itself.  For today's lab
	Choose a website that you frequent that has data (text) that could be scraped from it's HTML (this could be Facebook, CNN, Kitty Pictures, whatever)
	Write some code that collects at least 10 pieces of information from the webiste (e.g. friends from Facebook, or headlines from CNN, comments on kitty pictures, etc)
	Create a new web page that displays ONLY the information you collected in step 2

The page you create can be very simple. You only need to display the information in a readable format.  No fancy formatting required ... we'll save that for next time :)
To get checked off, be prepared to show:
	The original website you got your data from
	Your code in lab16_LastName.py format (Please add your name and your partner's name as a comment in the beginning of your program. )
	Your resulting html page that you created
