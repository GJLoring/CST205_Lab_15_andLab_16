Problem 2:
Have some fun with different library functions by figuring out how to get Python to:

Print out a calendar of the month you were born
Tell you how many days it is until your next birthday
What day of the week was the Declaration of Independence ratified by the Continental Congress? (write a program that prints out Monday, Tuesday, etc)
