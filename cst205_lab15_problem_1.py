Problem 1:

Use a function from the random library to simulate rolling dice.  Write a function that rolls a single die and then use that function to build a program that let's the user play craps. The basic rules of craps are:

1. A player rolls two six-sided dice and adds the numbers rolled together.
2. On this first roll, a 7 or an 11 automatically wins, and a 2, 3, or 12 automatically loses, and play is over. If a 4, 5, 6, 8, 9, or 10 are rolled on this first roll, that number becomes the "point.‚Äù
3. The player continues to roll the two dice again until one of two things happens: either they roll the "point" again, in which case they win; or they roll a 7, in which case they lose.
